Observe best practices

We are currently compiling an open source software security best practices document.  Link to come.


Keep up to date
---------------

Unless otherwise specified, it is recommended to regularly update to the most recent version of this software package, and to review the security test results, ideally automating this process and including an alerting feature.

Observe the [vulnerabilities badge](README.md#security) on the project README page and follow the link to consult independent test results by [snyk.io](https://snyk.io) of the latest commit.

Should you discover a novel security issue or vulnerability, kindly __report your findings to security@reelyactive.com__, and provide sufficient detail to effectively address, if not resolve, the issue.
